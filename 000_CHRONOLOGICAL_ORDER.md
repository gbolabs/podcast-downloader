# Chronological Order of Files

This file is named with a prefix (000_) so that when files are sorted alphabetically, they appear in the order they were created.

## Creation Order (Oldest to Newest)

1. **podcast_downloader.py** - Main application script
2. **test_downloader.py** - Unit tests
3. **README.md** - Main documentation
4. **EXAMPLE_OUTPUT.md** - Example output demonstration
5. **demo.py** - Interactive demo script
6. **QUICK_START.md** - Quick start guide
7. **SUMMARY.md** - Technical summary
8. **USAGE_EXAMPLE.md** - Detailed usage example
9. **FILES.md** - File inventory (this file was created last)

## How to View Files in Chronological Order

This will show files starting with:

- EXAMPLE_OUTPUT.md
- FILES.md
- podcast_downloader.py
- QUICK_START.md
- README.md

Note: The numeric prefix ensures chronological ordering when sorted alphabetically.
